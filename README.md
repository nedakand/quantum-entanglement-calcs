# Quantum Entanglement Correlation Calculations

This project computes polarization correlations for entangled and non-entangled photon pairs
using linear algebra and quantum mechanical operators. It includes calculations of expectation
values and evaluates Bell inequalities for different polarizer angle configurations.

The code was developed as part the Quantum Entanglement Lab in PHYS340 and demonstrates translating
theoretical quantum mechanics into executable numerical calculations.

## Features
- Photon polarization states represented as vectors
- Polarizer operators implemented as 2x2 matrices
- Calculation of correlation functions for entangled and non-entangled states
- Evaluation of Bell inequality violations
